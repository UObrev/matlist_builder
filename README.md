# MatList Build Demo Kiosk (v1)

## User Onboarding
Home Depot’s Material List Builder (MatList Build) is a new AI tool that’s critical to the company’s future. We propose setting up a demo kiosk to support user onboarding.


## Pro Demo Kiosk
Many Pros are not efficient with digital tools. The Pro Demo Kiosk is designed to build familiarity and confidence through hands-on experience. The program follows three steps: **watch a demo, try it out, and take control of a real project**.

### Watch Demo
- A trained store associate provides a live demonstration of the tool in action.

### Try Out
- The associate encourages Pros to practice using the tool on a prepared sample case.

### Take Control
- Associates prompt Pros to enter their own existing projects and guide them on practical, real-world use.


## Success Metrics
- Number of demos performed at the kiosk.
- Number of quotes, orders generated.
